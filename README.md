## Stat Bonus Macros
These Macros simply return the bonus/detriment to a given stat.  For example a +2 bonus from dex is seen in the [Dex Bonus Macro].

## Attack Type Macros
These are the fundamental attack macros. The [Untrained] Marco is an example of this type of macro it does not use the profiecency bonus in its calculations.

## Weapon Macros
These represent attacks with various weapons.  The [Dueling Brockdor] macro is an example of this type of macro.  The ease of creating these macros allows for additional weapons or easy editing should a more powerful weapon become available.
